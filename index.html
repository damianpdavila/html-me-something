        <p>Everyone has activities that they do growing up. I thought it would be interesting to try to rank my favorite activities -- <mark>the stuff I've loved to do</mark> -- and share a few.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, it was a challenge to just pick a top 10.  The unedited list was over 30 things I've loved to do over the years.!</p>
        <p>Anyhoo, with no further ado, here's the <em>Top 10 Stuff Damian Has Loved To Do</em>:</p>

                <h2>1. Exploring</h2>
                <p>Hiking or just tramping around was one of my first favorite things to do.  Although raised a city kid, Los Angeles was in a basin ringed by small mountains, many of which contained public parks and trails. Plus, there was always the backyard or the alleyway or ....</p>

                <h2>2. Cooking</h2>
                <p>Latch-key kids often have to cook for themselves, and I was no exception. My parents would not return home from work for many hours after I was home from school. So, necessity means you learn how to cook stuff.</p>
                <p>That led to watching cooking shows like the Galloping Gourmet as a kid, then attempting more sophisticated dishes, then working in a commercial kitchen, then finally building and owning two restaurants.</p>

                <p>I WAS OBSESSED. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AFw4wH2Mko" target="_blank">Watch the awesome 1970's video!</a></p>

                <h2>4. Sketching</h2>
                <p>I was that kid who loved to sit for hours just drawing sketches of cool stuff like customized cars, cartoon characters, sea life, etc. etc.</p>

            <section id="skateboard">
                <h2>5. Skateboarding</h2>
                <p>Skateboarding in Southern California in the '70s was a culture, a world unto it's own. It had it's own language, it's own art style, it's own dress and hair and music and everything else that defines a community.</p>
                <p>As an immigrant, I didn't really look the part, and it was hopeless to convince my parents to splurge on a "real" skateboard, but it didn't matter.  I was a skateboarder and I loved it!</p>

            <section id="photography">
                <h2>6. Photography</h2>
                <p>Never quite figured out why I enjoyed photography so much. Back in the day there was only film, so patience, trial-and-error, and frustration were the usual outcomes.</p>
                <p>But still, I would shoot regularly with my dad's Instamatic camera, and eventually persisted in convincing him that HE <em>needed</em> one. It was a good Christmas that year....</p>

                        <p>I even tried my hand at the darkroom.  Cool, but thank goodness for digital.</p>

            <section id="ridebike">
                <h2>7. Ride Bike</h2>
                <p>Probably the single most influential thing I ever did in my youth.  It was my first taste of freedom.  It introduced me to BMX culture in Southern California and then in South Florida.  Like the skateboard, I gained a sense of accomplishment doing awesome tricks -- plus I was a better biker than skateboarder.</p>
                <p>I pushed myself physically; overcame real tangible physical fear. And of course, boys being boys, helped set me up higher in the social pecking order than I otherwise would have.  Good times.</p>

                        <p>Very similar to my first bike.  I later graduated to "real" bikes like a Huffy, a Schwinn, and finally a true BMX racer from Webco.</p>

            </section>
            <section id="write">
                <h2>8. Write Stories and Poetry</h2>
                <p>My best guess is that I started writing stories out of the need to unload a bit to <em>someone.</em>  A latch-key only child spends a <strong>log</strong> of time alone.</p>
                <p>Anyway, no psycho-babble here.  Turns out I liked doing it and was pretty good.  Unfortunately, I developed the habit of writing during class instead of listening to the teacher which didn't actually turn out so well.</p>

                        <p>I wrote fiction all the time during grade school years.  Now it's almost all non-fiction crap for work purposes. &lt;sigh&gt;</p>

            <section id="freedive">
                <h2>9. Freediving, Scuba, Freediving</h2>
                <p>Like so many other kids, I was fascinated with Jacques Cousteau and his underwater world.  Turns out I really enjoy being in the water, maybe because I'm island born and have always lived near the ocean.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed snorkeling aka freediving so much that I managed to convince my mom to allow me to become a certified scuba diver when I was 15.  Not sure how I pulled that one off, but I saved my pennies working odd jobs and get certified.</p>
                <p>Scuba diving was incredible. Such an amazing experience releasing the tether to the surface and gravity for a while.  Funny thing is, I actually enjoyed freediving more. So I freedive regularly but having donned a tank in quite a few years. Go figure.</p>

                        <p>There's nothing quite like the freedom and adventure and physical challenge of freediving.</p>

            <section id="music">
                <h2>10. Discover New Music</h2>
                <p>Not especially original with this one.  Most people develop at least an interest in music at some point in their lives.  I've included it because maybe as an immigrant, maybe as a kid growing up in the turbulent world of the late '60s and early 70's, music reflected the changing societal values and experiences and boundaries.</p>
                <p>I got to see and experience the social upheaval of that time through the lens of creative people often very different from myself and my background.  Much later on, in college, I learned how emotion could blend with the cerebral to create something even more powerful: jazz.</p>
                <p>And oh yeah, it helped me get the girl who became my wife.</p>

                <p>Coding is a difficult mistress.</p>
